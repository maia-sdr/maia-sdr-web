# Why the name "Maia SDR"?

[Maia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maia_(star)) is a star in the
[Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) cluster. I chose the name
because I like how it sounds, and because it is related to astronomy. The name
vaguely hints at radio astronomy, which is a topic dear to me. Even though Maia
SDR has not been developed with radio astronomy in mind as a potential use case,
it could potentially be of interest to the radio astronomy FPGA community.

# Isn't "FPGA-based SDR" a misnomer? {#misnomer}

Sure. If most of the digital signal processing is done in FPGA, it is not done
in software. I know and partly share comments in the SDR community about how the
term "SDR" is often used inappropriately and has become somewhat of a
buzzword. In this sense, calling Maia SDR an "SDR" is not very
appropriate. However, I cannot think of a better term. I do not know of a word
other than SDR that evokes the same ideas in terms of functionality, hardware
devices, community, etc.

Also, in a certain sense I think that "SDR" is not a very bad name for Maia
SDR. As a project, it strives to explore in the future concepts such as
relatively fast-synthesis using open source FPGA toolchains, on demand
reconfiguration, and other concepts related to flexibility in terms of
functionality. In this sense, Maia SDR has more in common with a software radio
application than with a silicon radio. Ultimately, the flexibility might matter
more than whether the DSP computations are done in LUTs or in an ALU.

# How is "Maia SDR" pronounced?

Maia is pronounced in English as /ˈmeɪə/, but I often use the Spanish
pronunciation /'maja/ (English *my-ah*). This is closer to the original Greek and Latin
pronunciations. You can use whichever you prefer.
